About
--------
This original hud was made by raysfire, currently maintained by CriticalFlaw. mystHUD is a custom game ui modification for Team Fortress 2, it combines a few elements from multiple other huds but using rayshud as its core.

I like rayshud, which is why I am NOT going to edit most of its contents. mystHUD are my edits of rayshud with changes such as edits to certain elements that I find very 'off', or can be improved to my liking.

My edit of rayshud was published because there are requests for it.

Difference
----
The biggest and most obvious difference in this edit is changing the main theme of the hud from cyan to white. I am not a big fan of rayshud's cyan color. Another major change is making most hud elements white in color, rather than using the default TF2's dull white color.

This gives the hud a cleaner look as compared to rayshud.

Updates
----
You can expect this hud to be updated pretty regularly. The updates will mostly be forked over from rayshud as soon as he updates it. Otherwise, I usually update the hud myself by referring to the updated hud files in an update.

I do not make huds and have limited knowledge on it, therefore you may find the hud not very well maintained.
